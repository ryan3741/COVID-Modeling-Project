# COVID-Modeling-Project
Code modeling the impact of the return of Stanford students on COVID-19 cases within Santa Clara community, students, and essential campus workers

code_seir_simulator_new contains the code neccessary to run the three population model to infer future case trajectory base upon different reopening scenarios.

code_infer_RO_Santa_Clara uses recent Santa Clara case data to predict the current RO within the community

code_Seeding_SEIR_0_Network provides the code neccessary to infer initial amounts of susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered populations based upon current COVID-19 case data in the locations that students are coming from.
